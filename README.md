# Requirements 

**NodeJS** 16.0.0 or higher - **https://nodejs.org/en/**

**YTDL** - run `npm i -g ytdl` in an command prompt with node installed

**FFMPEG** - watch this **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECI72XEox0** (if not installed)

# Tutorial

Select a drive (we will use `c:/` which is recommended because thats where most important programs are)

Create a folder in the drive called `PATH_Programs` (you should already have it if you watched the ffmpeg tutorial)

Drag `download.exe` and `download-search.exe` in that folder!

Add the folder to `PATH VARIABLES` (should already be done if you watched the ffmpeg tutorial)


And Done!

Go into a command prompt in the directory you like (navigate through directories using `cd ./example/media/audio`

Type `download`/`download-search` and hit enter!

Then just answer to the questions and you're done! Enjoy Your Music!
